# Next.js Developer Test Assignment

## Important Note

This assignment is designed to assess your approach to problem-solving and your familiarity with key technologies. While we've provided a comprehensive list of features and requirements, **we don't expect you to implement everything perfectly**. Focus on demonstrating your strengths and completing what you can within the suggested 4-6 hour timeframe. Quality over quantity - we prefer seeing a few well-implemented features rather than many rushed ones.
